<p> To make people more aware of the natural history collections at UBC, the Herbarium wanted to open up these important resources to a much wider, more diverse audience: you! As more of the Beaty Biodiversity Museum's specimens are being digitized and made available online, people will be better able to understand the types of objects and organisms collected by natural history museums, and the role the public can play to help preserve these priceless collections. In the case of Gerald Straley's B.C. plant collection, objects originally collected for their scientific value also hold tremendous historical and aesthetic appeal. Instead of this important collection being used only by a small group of experts, they can now be appreciated and used by a wide range of viewers. 

<p>Many of our specimens are loaned for study by researchers around the world.  With the availability of digital images they will now be able to view the specimens on-line to decide if they need to see the specimen in person. Reduced physical handling of the collection will help ensure the preservation of the collection for future generations, while still allowing experts to enhance our collection through remote curation based on high resolution images. In addition, many research questions, such as those related to climate change, invasive species, and altering species distributions across British Columbia, are becoming increasing concerns and researchers are looking more to the historical natural history record for insight into these dramatic ecological changes. This project will spark new interest in the botanical, historical, and ecological significance of the collections at UBC and will draw attention to the talented and inspiring individuals who have contributed to understanding of British Columbia's rich natural history. 

<p> As the launch of this project will closely coincide with the launch of the Beaty Biodiversity Museum in early 2010, the Gerald Straley B.C. digitized collection is a stepping stone for the public, to make our collections accessible and to raise awareness of the historical legacy and biological richness of all our Museum collections.  

<p>This project could not have been possible without the generous support of:
