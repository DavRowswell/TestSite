<p><b>David Tarrant</b>, host of CBC-TV's Canadian Gardener, shares a few stories of Gerald Straley, friend and colleague
<br>March 2009         

<p>As a teacher, Gerald had that incredible gift to be able to engage both professional and amateurs alike when explaining the wonders of the plant world.
He and I worked for a number of years together at the University of British Columbia Botanical Garden so I was constantly aware of his passion to share his knowledge.

<p>On several occasions we travelled on field trips or to conferences and also led a couple of overseas garden tours together.  I remember arriving with him and other friends at a conference in North Carolina. It was after dark but close to the hotel there was an area of natural vegetation visible under a lamp post. As soon as he got off the bus he rushed over and picked one of his favourite flowers and had to tell the rest of us all about it!!

<p>In the 80s we led a tour to see the gardens and wildflowers of Australia. Part of the tour was in Western Australia where by some mix up our group was put on a bus with a regular bus tour to see the wild flowers.
It was an uneasy situation, as the Australians were quite content seeing the bright patches of incredible wild flowers from the comfort of the bus while we, of course, wanted to stop at everyone.  
The bus driver cooperated with Gerald and I from time to time, and the Australians were totally amazed at the speed with which our group could leave the bus, gather around our illustrious leader, while they just looked out the windows!!!    
By the third day they were joining us and learning more about their native flora from this Virginian than they thought possible. The delicate mechanism of the trigger flower pollination intrigued them no end!!

<p>On a joint field trip with the UBC Friends of the Garden to Alberta we stopped in a boggy area outside Hinton and wandered through drifts of native Lady's Slipper Orchids (<i>Cypripedium</i>) and other beautiful flowers. With Gerald tirelessly and enthusiastically interpreting everything we found, it was of course in summer and the days were long, we got so carried away with the flowers it was 11pm, and still light of course, by the time we reached our Hotel in Edmonton.

<p>Gerald's university students were always turned into a keen bunch. I can see him now with groups of them keenly hanging on his words, even and often in the pouring rain!!

<p>His book 'Trees of Vancouver' published in 1992 was dedicated to his parents as follows.
<blockquote>"I fondly dedicate this book to my parents who taught me to observe."</blockquote>
They most certainly did and Gerald passed his observations on to everyone who was fortunate enough to know him.

<p><b>Roy Forster</b>, former Director and Curator of VanDusen Botanical Garden, memory of Gerald Straley
<br>March 2009      
       
<p>During the decades of the 1970's, 80's, and 90's, I was Curator/Director of the VanDusen Botanical Garden, and instrumental in hiring Gerald for the position of Education Co-ordinator. At the time he was a U.S. citizen and we had to convince the Immigration Department that he was he was not only the best of the applicants, but that he was the only one truly suited to the job. Our confidence was rewarded by Gerald's fine performance in the role. Already a fine botanist and part-time entomologist , he freely gave of his knowledge to the many volunteers, the staff, and at large through his publications and work for the Flora of Canada. The garden had a travel program at the time. Gerald led several botanical tours. One in particular was memorable - a spring tour to California where his love of wild flowers was given full expression. Gerald's position was funded by a Government grant, administered by the Park Board, and later by the VanDusen Botanical Garden Association.
<p>Gerald's move to the UBC botanical Garden was almost pre-destined, as there his botanical skills could be fully expressed.
